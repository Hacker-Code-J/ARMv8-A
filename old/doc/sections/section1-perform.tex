\subsection{Performance Metrics and Benchmarks}
A computer user focuses on minimizing \textbf{response time} (or \textbf{execution time}), while a warehouse-scale operator aims to maximize \textbf{throughput}, the total work completed in a given period.\sidenote{John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson,

We want to relate the performance of two different computers, say, $X$ and $Y$. For the phase \begin{center}
``$X$ is faster than $Y$'',
\end{center} we can define it in terms of execution times: let
\begin{itemize}
	\item \( T_X \) denote the execution time of computer \( X \),
	\item \( T_Y \) denote the execution time of computer \( Y \).
\end{itemize} If \( X \) is faster than \( Y \), then:
\[
T_X < T_Y
\]
This inequality means that the time required for \( X \) to complete the task is less than the time required for \( Y \).

In particular, ``$X$ is $n$ times faster than $Y$''\sidenote{
The computer $X$ is 1.5 times faster than $Y$ means that \[
1.5=\frac{\text{Execution Time}_Y}{\text{Execution Time}_X}.
\] If $\text{Execution Time}_X=10$s and $\text{Execution Time}_Y=15$s, TFAE:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $X$ is 1.5 times faster than $Y$
	\item $Y$ is about 0.76 times slower than $X$.
\end{itemize}
} means that \[
\frac{\text{Execution Time}_Y}{\text{Execution Time}_X}=n.
\] Since execution time is the reciprocal of performance, the following relationship holds:
\[
n = \frac{\text{Execution Time}_Y}{\text{Execution Time}_X} =\frac{\displaystyle 1/\text{Performance}_Y}{\displaystyle 1/\text{Performance}_X}= \frac{\text{Performance}_X}{\text{Performance}_Y}.
\]
where: \begin{itemize}
	\item \( n > 1 \): Computer \( X \) is \( n \) times faster than \( Y \).
	\item \( n < 1 \): Computer \( X \) is \( 1/n\) times slower than \( Y\). In other words, computer $Y$ is $1/n$ times faster than computer $X$.
\end{itemize}
